# Engineering Challenge \- “To Do List” 

# Full Stack (Web)

Build a full‑stack “To Do List” application. Implement both the **web frontend client** and a **minimal required backend API**. Candidates should be prepared to explain their approach and deep‑dive into their code during a live screen‑sharing session.

## Implementation Details

* **Backend:** Implement a simple backend API (e.g. Node/Express or similar) that supports the data and operations needed for the To Do List. Backend storage can range from in-memory or file-based to a full database, as appropriate to your solution. Deployment of the backend is optional.  
* **Frontend:** Build a web client that connects to your custom backend API and supports **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on To Do tasks**. The client must allow the user to **log in** and perform these operations on their own tasks. The UI must be **responsive**. Implement the UI/UX as you see fit. Deployment of the frontend is optional.


Suggested BE hint:

* Prefer a REST-style API (resource URLs, standard HTTP methods, JSON request/response).  
* Use standard HTTP semantics (e.g. 200/201 for success, 400 for validation errors, 401/403 for auth, 404 for missing resource).

Suggested UX hint:

* User should be able to log in from the landing sign in page  
* User should be able to see a list of tasks after signing in  
* User can change the order of tasks in the list.  
* User can search for tasks.  
* User can open a task to view or edit it on a task detail screen.  
* User can create, update, and delete tasks (full CRUD).


## Deliverables

Please take your time to deliver a quality solution that shows your ability. Include:

* A **README** file that contains:  
  * Deployment / running instructions. Assume that we’re running this on a Mac. Bonus points if instructions are for deployments to a distributed cloud infrastructure  
  * A summary of the assignment  
    * Your overall approach  
    * What features you completed  
    * Given more time, what else would you have liked to complete and how long it would have taken you?  
    * Given more time, what else would you have done to make the project more robust?  
* Production-ready code that:  
  * Your code checked into a git repository that can be shared with us (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc…). We should be able to run the code  
  * Follows community standard syntax and style  
  * Has no debug logging, TODOs, or FIXMEs  
  * Has test coverage to ensure quality and safety

## What we look for

* Clean code. Style we’re looking for: concise but descriptive.  
* Enough functionality or code to show us your understanding of fundamental development practices  
* Test coverage for your code using frameworks such as Jest, Mocha, Chai, or Enzyme. Bonus point if you are able to perform Test Driven Development  
* Bonus points: Code in a *functional*, concise, declarative way. Things we will look for: higher-order functions, function composition, correct use of basic data structures and manipulations (map, reduce, apply, etc.)  
* Bonus points for managing asynchronous or concurrent execution through high-level abstractions

**NOTE: If your exercise does not meet our minimum grading criteria then we will reach out to cancel this interview and remaining sessions.**
